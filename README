CANBOAT
-------

A small but effective set of command-line utilities to work with CAN networks
on BOATs. Guess you now know where the name comes from.

The most common version of CAN networks on board, and in fact at the moment
the only ones that this suite can analyze, are NMEA 2000 PGNs.

The NMEA 2000 database and implementation is copyrighted by the NMEA (National
Marine Electronics Association). Access is restricted to members and parties
that pay for it. If they do so they are not able to divulge the content of the
database, thus making it impossible for open source developers to get access
to it.

For this reason we have reverse engineered the NMEA 2000 database by network
observation and assembling data from public sources.

Due to NDA restrictions this project does not yet contain the necessary
code to talk directly with the most common CAN interface used in the marine
electronics world, the Actisense NGT-1. Binary versions of the necessary
programs can be obtained from
